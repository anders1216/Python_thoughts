Quite honestly, I am not that into Python

I've been using R for about a year now, so the switch from R to python is a bit difficult

I feel like Python is new because all the bugs that I've encoutered

Also, I feel like when doing statistical analysis, R is more user friendly and more useful

But that's just me...

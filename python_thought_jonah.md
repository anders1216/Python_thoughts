Python is very powerful and overwhelming at times.  I go through phases of feeling like 
I can do a lot with Python, then realize how much Python can actually do and realize that
I can barely do any of it.  All in all, Python is fun to learn because of the satisfaction
when you gain the ability to do something new.

Python is very helpful in visualizing and analyzing code. It saves a lot 
of time that would otherwise be spent on sorting, merging or color 
coding data in for a program like excel, where if the dataset becomes 
very big can get confusing quickly. SOmetimes, python is very 
frustrating when you are stuck on one code error for a very long time 
and you dont know how to fix it, eventhough you think it is something 
that is easy to do. Sometimes it makes you want to give up!

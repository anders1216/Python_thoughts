Python

Python is a relatively new language to me, and the second programming language I have
attempted to learn. The previous language I attempted was Java, and I made little leeway.
I find python to be more intuitive and easier to learn. I have not felt debilitated by 
the language limits in any way and suspect I would be hard pressed to find them. By all 
accounts python is an excellent language, especially for my field in the physical sciences.
